# Online Payments Fraud Detection using ML

Machine learning project that helps detect fraudelent transactions from a given dataset.

Online payments are the most common way people make transactions today. However, as online payments increase, so does the risk of fraud. This study aims to distinguish between fraudulent and non-fraudulent payments using a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about past fraudulent transactions that can be analyzed to detect fraud in online payments.

### Dataset 

The dataset includes 10 variables:

- `Step`: Represents a unit of time, where 1 step equals 1 hour.
- `Type`: Indicates the type of online transaction.
- `Amount`: Denotes the transaction amount.
- `NameOrig`: Identifies the customer initiating the transaction.
- `OldbalanceOrg`: Shows the balance before the transaction.
- `NewbalanceOrig`: Displays the balance after the transaction.
- `NameDest`: Specifies the recipient of the transaction.
- `OldbalanceDest`: Indicates the initial balance of the recipient before the transaction.
- `NewbalanceDest`: Represents the new balance of the recipient after the transaction.
- `IsFraud`: Indicates whether the transaction is fraudulent or not.
