    Feature engineering:
        Time to get our hands dirty with feature engineering. With the available information it is hard to train the model and get better results. Hence we move onto create new features by altering the existing features. In this we create three functions which creates a highly relevant feature for the domain

            - Difference in balance: It is an universal truth that the amount debited from senders account gets credited into the receivers account without any deviation in cents. But what if there is a deviation incase of the amount debited and credited. Some could be due to the charges levied by the service providers, yet we need to flag such unusual instances

            - Surge indicator: Also we have to trigger flag when large amount are involved in the transaction. From the distribution of amount we understood that we have a lot of outliers with high amount in transactions. Hence we consider the 75th percentile(450k) as our threshold and amount which is greater than 450k will be triggered as a flag

            - Frequency indicator: Here we flag the user and not the transaction. When there is a receiver who receives money from a lot of people, it could be a trigger as it can be for some illegal games of chance or luck. Hence it is flagged when there is a receiver who receives money for more than 20 times.

            - Merchant indicator: The customer ids in receiver starts with 'M' which means that they are merchants and they obviously will have a lot of receiving transactions. So we also flag whenever there is a merchant receiver
